By [Akhil Jalan](https://github.com/akhiljalan/) and [Noah Wu](https://github.com/N0ahW).

## Guide to this Repo

This is still a work in progress. We'll give detailed instructions about how to clone the repository and what to look for as we finish it up.

## Reproducibility

### Python Environment

We used the Magenta environment created by Google. If you're using Python 2.7 and Tensorflow 1.7, you should be able to run our code. But for full reproducibility, we suggest using their environment, which you can install from the instructions at: https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta#installation
